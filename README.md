# OBGameplayAdjuster
Minecraft bukkit/spigot plugin to enforce various gameplay settings.

Use the /gpa to get the usage message

Useful for PVP servers where you want to enforce particular rules such as auto deop of op'd players.

The compiled jar file is also in the target folder of the repo so can be downloaded directly from there. This is also the complete Eclipse project so it should import into Eclipse (I was using Oxygen.3.a Release 4.7.3a).

Compiled for 1.17 and Java 16, but should work with older versions (up to a point).
