# OBGameplayAdjuster
Minecraft bukkit/spigot plugin to enforce various gameplay settings.<br>

Use the /gpa to get the usage message

Useful for PVP servers where you want to enforce particular rules such as auto deop of op'd players.<br>
This was a requested feature for some of our PlayerServers users who want to PVP and don't trust each other :-)<br>
More to come!

Compiled for 1.18 and Java 17, but should work with older versions (up to a point).
